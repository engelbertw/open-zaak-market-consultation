# How to respond

This page explains the process and timing for responding to the market consultation.

## Starting points for the market consultation

With OpenZaak we are taking an important step towards realising the [Common Ground](https://commonground.nl/cms/view/54476259/over-common-ground) (Dutch) principles. But we are well aware that OpenZaak is only of value if it is actively used and developed further.

Our goal is to create a community in which government, suppliers and partners work together. A community, without lock-ins, that works for all parties involved. It is also in this collective spirit that weâ€™re setting up this market consultation.

We want to use your experience, inspiration and brainpower to come to the right set-up. In order to be able to have the right conversation, we have set out our needs, proposals and questions to the market in this document.

## Procedure of the market consultation

The market consultation consists of two parts:

1. A written response to our questions. We're deliberately not restricting the form and length of your answers. These responses should be received by 1-5-2020 before 17:00. You can send your answers to <niels.lindeboom@dimpact.nl>. Based on your responses we will review our proposal and adjust it if there are good suggestions. This modified proposal will then become the starting point for the workshop (part two of the consultation).
2. Optional: one or more workshops where together we will determine the various needs and prerequisites within the community (participation only on request of OpenZaak). After submitting your answers, you will receive a message no later than 13-5-2020 if you are invited for the workshop. This will take place on 20th and 21st of May 2020. With the invitation you will receive further information about the exact time and location.

Dimpact is responsible for communication about this market consultation. You can contact Niels Lindeboom at <niels.lindeboom@dimpact.nl> or 06-22270923.

## Market consultation report

We will produce an anonymized report after interested parties have answered the questions from the market consultation document and the workshop has taken place. This report will be made available to all market consultation participants, and will be published with the announcement of a possible tender.
